# Office Suites and Document Editing

CVOS provides multiple document editing suites for various file formats.  In no particular order, these are the document suites that are installed and supported.


## WPS Office

WPS Office is visually quite similar to MS office and so users of MS Office should have no trouble using this suite.  WPS Office includes programs for text documents, spreadsheets, and slide-show style presentations.  These programs can be found in the applications menu under the category 'Office.'  WPS Office works well with MS Office formats.  You are still encouraged to verify formatting on important documents and when possible render your final document to a PDF to ensure no elements shift around.  WPS Office is offered as-is.


### Appearance

The programs have the following appearance:

### Saving Documents

It is important to note that WPS Office does not save into the MS Office format by default.  When you save your documents, be sure to change the menu option as shown:

![WPS Writer File-type Menu](/img/cvos-office-wps_file_type.png)

Note that other programs use the same menu, but with appropriately different choices available.


### Changing Defaults

The examples shown here are done with WPS Writer, but are nearly identical to WPS Spreadsheets and WPS Presentation.


#### File Format

As it is an extra step to save into the MS Office format every time and this is generally the format most people use, the default can be changed as follows:

Open the WPS Menu and select options:

![WPS Options Menu](/img/cvos-office-wps_menu.png)

Select 'General and Save' then change the 'Save files as default:' option to your liking:

#### Welcome Screen

By default all programs in WPS Office show a screen with a selection of templates.  If you prefer to instead open a new blank document follow these steps:

Open the WPS Menu and select options:

![WPS Options Menu](/img/cvos-office-wps_menu.png)

Select 'General and Save' then change the 'Start With:' option to 'New Document':

## LibreOffice

LibreOffice is a standard Linux desktop office suite with programs for managing text, spreadsheets, slideshows, database connections and more.  LibreOffice has known formatting issues when saving into MS Office formats and is not recommended for managing documents with forms embedded such as various application forms.  LibreOffice is offered as-is.


### Appearance

LibreOffice has the following appearance:

### Saving Documents

It is important to note that LibreOffice does not save into the MS Office format by default. When you save your documents, be sure to change the menu option as shown:

![LibreOffice Writer File-type Menu](/img/cvos-office-libreoffice_file_type.png)

While this example is shown with LibreOffice Writer, a similar menu is available in all LibreOffice programs with appropriate file types.


### Changing Defaults

The examples shown here are done with LibreOffice Writer.  Similar steps will apply to other LibreOffice programs.


#### File Format

As it is an extra step to save into the MS Office format every time and this is generally the format most people use, the default can be changed as follows:

Open the LibreOffice options window using the Tools menu:

![LibreOffice Tools Menu](/img/cvos-office-libreoffice_tools_menu.png)

Select 'Load/Save' then select your preferred file format:

## Cloud Office suites

### MS Office 365

All UTD students are provided with access to MS Office 365 which is a cloud based document suite.  This suite is able to operate on any device with a web browser, however the CV Admins recommend using Google Chrome for the best experience.  To access Office 365 use the [MS Office Portal](https://portal.office.com/).


### Google Drive

Google provides an online office suite called Google Drive.  Google Drive can be accessed at [https://drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com).  For obvious reasons Google Drive works best with Google Chrome.
