# Printing

While UTD is largely a paperless campus, there are still some classes and instructors which require paper copies of assignments.  Black and white laser printers are available in the lounge for CV students to print schoolwork.  The use of these printers is monitored.


## How to Print

To print from most programs you can simply use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+p`.  The notable exception to this is Google Chrome where this will not bring up the system print menu but will bring up Chrome's internal print menu.  Regardless of the menu in use, ensure that the printer "Carlson" is selected and press print.

**Note:** By default, all print jobs are printed with duplex printing enabled.  If you do not wish to print your job with duplex printing enabled, ensure that you disable this setting before submitting your print job.

PDF documents should automatically open using the evince PDF reader.  If your PDF documents open with another program this can be reset to by right-clicking on any PDF, selecting 'Properties' and then selecting 'Open With' then finally selecting 'Document Viewer' from the list of available programs.  Google Chrome and Firefox are known to print PDFs loaded in a new window without issue.

**Note:** There is currently a known issue in E-Learning wherin the CrocoDoc PDF viewer may fail to load a PDF in a format suitable for printing.  For this reason OIT and CV Admins recommend opening PDFs in a new window and printing from there, or if possible downloading the PDF to the local disk and then printing from Document Viewer.


## Cost of Printing

CV students are not billed directly for print jobs run in the lounge.  Instead students are provided with an automatically tracked balance to pay for prints.  The cost to print a document is equivelent to the number of pages of paper used to print the document.  All new accounts are provided with a starting balance sufficient to get through the start of school.

After the first few weeks of classes it may become obvious that you will need to print many documents during the semester.  If you find this is the case you will need to bring in paper to top off your print balance.  The preferred paper is Georgia Pacific 92 bright, 20 pound paper in reams no larger than 500 sheets.  The packaging for this paper looks like this:

The preferred paper is available at area retailers such as Target (on the UTD 883 bus route) as well as available at many retailers within walking distance.  Please ensure that the paper you purchase is 92 bright or greater as Georgia Pacific sells paper in a nearly identical package which is gray that is 88 bright.  Due to substantially increased wear on our surprisingly expensive laser printers, we do not accept 88 bright or lower.

We kindly ask that you do not purchase paper in reams larger than 500 sheets as 500 sheets is the maximum size our printers can accept at one time.  We will of course accept smaller reams. Unfortunately we cannot credit you for legal paper, construction paper, card stock, or any other specialty paper (our printers and admins are very picky).


## Requesting a Refund

As a general rule we do not grant refunds for printed jobs, so please think before you print.  "Accidentally" printing two copies is not cause for a refund, so if your job hasn't printed after submitting one copy, please seek assistance before repeatedly clicking the print button.  Circumstances we do grant refunds for are:

* Print jobs that come out blank
* Print jobs that never print
* Print jobs that are administratively cancelled

Additionally, we grant refunds for individual pages if there are print errors that are the fault of the print system.  This includes issues such as toner smudges or pages lost to paper jams.

To request a refund, navigate to [https://paper.collegiumv.org](https://paper.collegiumv.org) in your preferred web browser and log in.  In the left column select 'Recent Print Jobs' then use the 'refund' link in the far right column to request a refund on the appropriate job.  All print refund requests are reviewed by the administrator and are corroborated with either print logs or maintenence logs.  Refund requests are generally processed within one week.


# Scanning

A flatbed scanner is available in the lounge to scan documents and papers.  In general the scanner can be found on the social side on the table under the scrolling electronic sign.  The scanner uses a standard USB A to USB B-Micro cable and requires no external power cable.  Under no circumstances is the cable to be seperated from the scanner.  Doing so is grounds for loosing computer access.

Two programs are known to work well with the scanner:

## Simple Scan

Simple scan is the recommended program for scanning almost all types of documents.  Simply plug in the scanner to the workstation you are using and launch Simple Scan to begin.  If you are scanning a single page simply press scan.  If you are scanning multiple pages though it is possible to select 'All Pages From Feeder' and swap out what page is on the bed while the scanner returns to start the next pass.


## The GIMP

The GNU Image Manipulation Program is also able to operate the scanner.  You may wish to use this program if you are scanning a document which you will then need to do substantial editing on such as a photograph that needs to be cropped and retouched or other such image processing.  The use of the scanner with The GIMP is beyond the scope of this article and if this is a feature you intend to use, you are encouraged to read [documentation for The GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/docs/).
