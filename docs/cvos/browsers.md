# Internet Browsers

CVOS provides many standard and some not so standard web browsers.  These browsers may all be found in the main menu under the category "Internet."

## Currently Installed Browsers

### Firefox

Mozilla's Firefox browser.  Very stable, very standard, fully supported and follows the current release (not ESR) from Mozilla.  Firefox does not support flash or other proprietary plugins such as WideVine DRM.  Netflix will not work in Firefox.  For more information please consult the [Firefox Manual](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox).


### Google Chrome

Google's Chrome browser.  Very fast and well integrated with the Google ecosystem.  Chrome is fully supported and generally follows the current release from Google.  Google Chrome supports flash and WideVine DRM.  Netflix and Mastering Physics/Chemistry are known to work in Google Chrome.  For advanced technical reasons, the Google Chrome icon has vanished, if you happen to find it, please return it to the nearest CV Administrator.  For more information please consult the [Google Chrome Manual](https://support.google.com/chrome/#topic=3227046).


### Chromium

The open source upstream to Google Chrome.  Quite fast and very similar in appearance to Chrome.  Chromium is not compatible with features such as Google session syncing and will not work with all flash content.  Chromium is offered as an alternative to Chrome.
