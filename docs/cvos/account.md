# Accounts

Because Collegium V maintains a separate network from the rest of the university, a separate login is required to access it.  These logins are available to members of the program only, and it is a serious violation of both university policy and state codified law to share your login.

## Registering an account

To register an account, navigate to [http://account.collegiumv.org](http://account.collegiumv.org) and follow the onscreen prompts.  The process is summarized below:

1. Input your netID; this will reveal a second field for you to choose a username.
    * If your netID is not recognized, please contact an admin for assistance.
    * While you may choose any username you desire, we suggest something short and all lower-case.
    * Vulgar usernames will be removed from the system and the relevant user will be reported to Honors College staff.
2. An email will be sent to your UTD email account containing a link to activate your account.
    * For security reasons the link is only valid for 1 hour from the time it is created.
3. Clicking on the emailed link will dispatch a second email to your UTD account containing a temporary password.
4. Log in with your temporary password and change it to something only you know.

## Reset your password

Resetting your password is very similar to creating a new account and can be done at any time via [http://account.collegiumv.org](http://account.collegiumv.org).

1. Enter the netID associated with your account.  If you already have an account, this will cause the "Change Password" button to appear.
2. Click the button labeled "Change Password".
3. Check your UTD email account for an email with a password reset link.
4. After clicking the password reset link, a temporary password will be emailed to you.
5. Log in and change your password to something only you know.

## Change your password

If you already know your password, but would like to change it to something different, this can be accomplished as follows:

1. Log into any CV workstation.
2. From the menu, launch the "Change Password" application.
3. Enter your old password in the top box and your new password in the bottom two boxes.
4. When you click "Change," the system will change your password.

There are a few issues you might see when changing your password.  First, if your current password isn't entered correctly, you will see red text stating as such:

![Wrong Password](/img/cvos-account-wrong_password.png)

If your old password is correct but your new passwords don't match, you will see this:

![Mismatched Passwords](/img/cvos-account-mismatch_password.png)

After you have successfully changed your password, it is recommended to log out and back in with the new password to ensure that all CV services have authenticated you using the new password.

## Account Settings

One of the features of CVOS is its deep customization potential.  All accounts are provisioned with sane defaults; however, some of the more common changes available are documented here.

### Graphical Session

By default, CV accounts use the Cinnamon desktop and in rare cases where hardware acceleration is not available, may fall back to the cinnamon2d desktop.  If you would prefer a different desktop environment, you are free to choose from any of our installed environments using the command line utility `modsession`.  Currently the following environments are installed, though only Cinnamon receives support from the CV Admins team.  All other options will be supported on a best-effort basis.

* Cinnamon (default)
* XFCE
* LXDE
* OpenBox
* Awesome
* i3

A brief description of each:

* Cinnamon - This environment uses modern style and flat elements with rounded corners for a sleek and styled experience.  It features a menu in the lower left hand corner, which can be accessed by pressing the mod4 key (Windows Key) on the keyboard as well as clicking on it.  The menu is text search-able and sorted by category.  Additionally mod4 + arrow keys will snap windows to the side of the screen gestured by the arrow key.  The clock by default will use 24 hour time but this can be changed by right clicking it.
    * Notable features
        * The default desktop wallpaper changes through the day to be darker at night.
        * Apps snap to the top and bottom of the screen allowing for horizontal splits.
    * Most Frequent Complaints
        * Cinnamon is slow to load (~5 seconds).
        * Program icons are sometimes missing in the menu
* XFCE - A much older environment that focuses more on efficiency and speed over looks.  Though it has a slightly dated appearance, many more modern themes are available for those that like a newer look. Users of Apple's OS macOS will likely appreciate XFCE's dock for frequently used applications.
    * Notable Features
        * This is the only environment that includes a dock by default.
        * XFCE has been around for many years, thousands of themes are available.
    * Most Frequent Complaints
        * The default interface feels dated.
        * Customizing XFCE is non-obvious.
* LXDE - Literally the "Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment," this environment was built to be nimble and quick.  Running on our high performance hardware, menus respond almost instantly and programs load quickly.  Most aspects can be changed simply by right-clicking.  A variant of LXDE was previously the default environment in the 2015-2016 school year.  This environment also has a distinctly "Windows XP" feel to it, with its fully text based menu and relatively simple styling.
    * Notable Features
        * Very fast.
        * Easily customized through right-clicking.
    * Most Frequent Complaints
        * The default desktop looks horrific
        * Programs aren't always where you might expect in the menu.
* OpenBox - The most minimal windowing environment that isn't based on tiling.  Once launched, you are provided with a default gray background.  Right-clicking gives the menu which contains programs.  This is the fastest non-tiling environment.
    * Notable Features
        * Very light and distraction free
        * Insanely fast
    * Most Frequent Complaints
        * Too minimalist
        * Not very intuitive.

The final environments from the list (Awesome and i3) fit into a different category called "tiling window managers."  The operation of this category is usually highly user-specialized, but tends to be entirely keyboard driven, focused on maximum productivity, and very minimalist.  If you're interested in trying any of these environments, the admins recommend doing so at night when you have time to play around and customize the system to your liking.  Because these environments are so customize-able, the operation and configuration thereof is considered beyond the scope of this article.

If your preferred environment is not listed above, feel free to [ask](bugs-and-features.md#feature-requests).  The only environment at this time which is specifically disallowed is KDE, as it does not play well with others.

### Authorized Keys

If you intend to make use of our [remote access server](aux-services.md#irc-idle-host), then you'll need to install at least one authorized key.  To do so use the command `modpubkeys` in a terminal while logged in to a lounge workstation.  This will open your $EDITOR or vi, by default.  Paste in your public key and save the temporary file.  You should see that your record is updated and your key will instantly be available for use.

## Additional Info

### File storage

CV accounts are provided with 10G of storage on our file-servers.  While we regularly make backups and make every attempt to ensure data integrity, you should always backup data that is important in multiple places.  The CV Admins recommend copying important documents to cloud services such as Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.  Its also a good idea to keep copies of current work on a flash drive (the CV Admins recommend using a name brand drive).

### Locking your screen

By default your screen will lock after 10 minutes of inactivity.  If you wish to lock your screen before you get up, there is an icon to do so in the main menu located in the lower left corner.  When you return you can press any key to wake up the terminal and use your password to unlock the screen.  Screens may be locked for a maximum of 45 minutes and applications will be forcibly closed at the end of this interval.  Screen locking is meant as a convenience for short intervals where it is necessary to step away from the computer, not for long periods of inactivity.
