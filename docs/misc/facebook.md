# Facebook Group

## Gaining Access

To be added to the Facebook group, simply make a request to join.  A moderator will process your request as soon as they are able to confirm your membership within the CV program, usually within 2 days.  At the start of the year there may be a larger delay due to large numbers of new students.


## Group Rules

In no particular order:

* All information must be directly relevant to CV.
* Strictly NO cross-posting
* This is a moderated group; please respect the moderators.

Posts that do not satisfy the requirements set out above are subject to removal.  In the event your post is removed, an administrator will make a good faith effort to contact you and explain why your post was removed.  In the event that you choose to make additional posts that fail to satisfy the requirements above, you may be removed from the group*.  If you are removed, you are welcome to contact an administrator and appeal the removal.

In the event of a dispute, the moderators will make a ruling based on the information at hand.  Please do not argue with the moderators, it just makes it awkward for all involved.

*It would be nice if there was some in-between state, but this is what Facebook provides for moderation.
